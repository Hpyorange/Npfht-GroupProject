North Peel Family Health Team (Website Redesign)

## Description
The website had not been updated in a while and there were a bunch of known user pain points which needed to be addressed. Our goal was to improve the user experience, modernise the aesthetic, and provide better access to the medical services.

My role is UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer.
